//! Offline hotlist generator: inverts a model's census (.warm file)
//! into a quantization-independent {layer, expert} preload seed for
//! crates/engine/hotlists/. Run on a machine that has decoded with the
//! model at least once (so the census exists), then check the output in.
//! Usage: hotlist-gen <model.gguf> > crates/engine/hotlists/<family>.hotlist
